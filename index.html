				<p>I am a 27 year old Quality Assurance Engineer at ASR Pro LLC. I have been working hard at learning new technologies for my craft. Currently I write in C# and use Selenium to do my test automation for the User Interface(UI). I consider myself fairly new to the Programming scene as I started teaching myself about 6-8 months ago.</p>

				<p>I enjoy spending time with my family and my son who is about 2 and half years old. I also enjoy turning wrenches on pretty much anything that is broken from cars on down to scooters. I also spend time learning new things about coding as well as how to rework what I have already done with more efficiency. Also one of my favorite pastimes is playing billards. I have played in Anerican Poolplayers Association(APA) since 2006 in that time I have been to Vegas once where my team and I placed 33 out of over 850 teams. I also have played in a local cash league. If I could afford a pool table in my house I believe my wife would go crazy as I would play as often as possible.</p>
