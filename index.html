	</h3>
		<p>I am <span id="myAge"></span> and work at Xtime Inc which is a part of Cox Automotive. I enjoy learning new things and believe that someone should attempt to learn one new thing a day.
		I apply this in my personal life as well as my work life. Due to this thinking I have managed to learn 3 different programming languages C#, Java, and Python. I am currently learning about
		AWS (Amazon Web Services) as well as the Microsoft counterpart Azure. Right now I am working on an application to allow people to start their own pool league and run pool tournaments through my application.
		In this application I will maintain skill level's, match history, and all things related to a pool league. It will be built with C# and Angular 4.</p>

		<p>Currently I am employee at <a href="http://www.asrpro.com">Xtime Inc.</a>. My primary function is to perform test case automation Inspect product. We use Java and Selenium for our UI automation currently.
		I have done test case automation and framework building in C# and Python. In Java I am using the already existing framework, adding to and maintaining the current framework when bugs arise.</p>

		<a name="hobbies" class="anchor" href="#hobbies"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hobbies
	</h3>
		<p>I enjoy spending time with my family whether it's grilling out, fishing, or letting the kids run around. I have two boys age <span id="oldestAge"></span> and <span id="youngestAge"></span> both of which can make you tired just by watching them run in circles.
		I also spend time learning new things about coding as well as how to rework what I have already done with more efficiency.</p>
		<p>My most favorite pastime is playing billards. I have played in American Poolplayers Association (APA) since 2006. While part of this league, I have traveled to Vegas 
		once where my team and I placed 33 out of over 850 teams. I have also played in a local cash league. I am looking forwared to the day when we acquire a pool table for our home. 
		My wife may go crazy as I would play as often as possible, but one can dream. Playing in these leagues as well as tournaments and hearing people complaint about the "Big Dogs" in the industry being money hungry is what inspired me to begin working on my own web application to allow anyone start their own league and run their own tournaments.</p>
