				<p>I am a 27 year old Quality Assurance Engineer at ASR Pro LLC. I have been working hard at learning new technologies for my craft. Currently, I write in C# 
                and use Selenium to do test automation for the User Interface (UI). I consider myself fairly new to the Programming scene as I started teaching myself about 6-8 months ago.</p>

				<a name="hobbies" class="anchor" href="#hobbies"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hobbies</h3>
				<p>I enjoy my family time. My son is about 2 and half years old and is the joy of my life. I enjoy turning wrenches on pretty much anything that is broken 
                from cars on down to scooters. I also spend time learning new things about coding as well as how to rework what I have already done with more efficiency.</p>
                <p>My most favorite pastime is playing billards. I have played in American Poolplayers Association (APA) since 2006. While part of this league, I have traveled to Vegas 
                once where my team and I placed 33 out of over 850 teams. I have also played in a local cash league. I am looking forwared to the day when we acquire a pool table for our home. 
                My wife may go crazy as I would play as often as possible, but one can dream.</p>
