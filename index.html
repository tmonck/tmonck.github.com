	</h3>
		<p>I enjoy my family time. My son is about 3 years old and is the joy of my life. I enjoy turning wrenches on pretty much anything that is broken 
		from cars on down to scooters. I also spend time learning new things about coding as well as how to rework what I have already done with more efficiency.</p>
		<p>My most favorite pastime is playing billards. I have played in American Poolplayers Association (APA) since 2006. While part of this league, I have traveled to Vegas 
		once where my team and I placed 33 out of over 850 teams. I have also played in a local cash league. I am looking forwared to the day when we acquire a pool table for our home. 
		My wife may go crazy as I would play as often as possible, but one can dream.</p>
